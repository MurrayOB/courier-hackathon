# Description of project:

Built from scratch

# Inspiration behind the project:

- I moved to Spain this year and I wanted to learn as much Spanish as possible but between working a 9 - 5 and just regular life I find it difficult to fit in the time to learn new vocabulary.

# Explanation of problem it solves (if any):

# Tools and technologies used to build it and how they all fit together:

Heroku (hosting), Firebase (database), Express/ Node.js (server), EJS (html/teplating),
Courier API (notifications), Tailwind (styling)

# Challenges you faced while building:

- Finding and connecting the different apis for the data source.
- Figuring out how to send dynamic notifications as some people have subscribed
  to different languages therefore needing the different translations.

# What you learned:
