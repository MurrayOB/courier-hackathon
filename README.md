# Word of the Day

## Description of project:

Using the Courier API, Courier's Node.js SDK and email designer, I've created an app that will notify you once daily with a new word in another language to help you learn vocabulary in your chosen language. This is my first hackathon ever, and I wanted to build something from scratch! I may add more features in the future.

## Inspiration behind the project:

I moved to Spain this year and I wanted to learn as much Spanish as possible but between working a 9 - 5 and just regular life I find it difficult to fit in the time to learn new vocabulary. Even learning one word per day or having a reminder to learn can help. 

## Explanation of problem it solves (if any):

I couldn't find an API that gave me exactly what I wanted so I built my own that would get a word, and description and translate it into any language. Another thing I wasn't sure using Courier, was how you might accommodate for users who subscribe in multiple languages, so I built my own function for that.

## Tools and technologies used to build it and how they all fit together:

Heroku (hosting), Firebase (database), Express/ Node.js (server), EJS (html/teplating),
Courier API (notifications), Tailwind (styling)

## Challenges you faced while building:

- Finding and connecting the different apis for the data source.
- Figuring out how to send dynamic notifications as some people have subscribed
  to different languages therefore needing the different translations. 

## What you learned:

I hadn't had much experience with Heroku before so I've had the chance to get familiar with it and its simplicity. I got to learn the Courier api and was very happy with the use of the SDK as it fit right into my preferred language/framework.
